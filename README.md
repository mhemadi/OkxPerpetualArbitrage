## Funding Arbitrage
Funding rates are a feature of perpetual markets. When a rate is positive, every 8 hours buyer have to pay a fee to sellers and vice versa.
By buying an asset in the spot market and going short on it on the perpetual market on an asset that has a positive funding rate, the trader can earn a funding income every 8 hours as long as the position is still open.
This app lets you see current potential positions that can be opened, and once chosen, opens the position for you.
